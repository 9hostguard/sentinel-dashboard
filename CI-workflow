# CI Workflow Configuration
# 
# This file has been replaced by a comprehensive multi-layered security workflow.
# The new workflow is located at: .github/workflows/security-scan.yml
#
# The new workflow includes:
# - Secret scanning and encryption checks
# - CodeQL static analysis for multiple languages  
# - Trivy vulnerability scanning
# - Semgrep custom rule-based detection
# - Dependency auditing (npm/pip/safety)
# - AI-based and heuristic scanning techniques
# - Automated artifact uploads and reporting
# - Scheduled and push-triggered scans
# - Critical vulnerability build failures
#
# To use this workflow in other repositories:
# 1. Copy .github/workflows/security-scan.yml to your repository
# 2. Adjust the language matrix in CodeQL job as needed
# 3. Modify dependency audit steps based on your tech stack
# 4. Configure repository secrets if needed (GITLEAKS_LICENSE)
# 5. Enable GitHub Advanced Security features
#
# Legacy simulated scan (replaced):
# name: Security Scan  
# on: [push]  
# jobs:  
#   audit:  
#     runs-on: ubuntu-latest  
#     steps:  
#     - uses: actions/checkout@v4  
#     - name: Run Security Scan  
#       run: |  
#         echo "Simulated security scan"  
#         echo "No vulnerabilities found"
