# Multi-Layered Security Workflow Documentation

## Overview

This repository now implements a comprehensive, multi-layered security workflow that replaces the previous simulated security scan. The new workflow provides real threat detection and advanced vulnerability scanning capabilities.

## Workflow Features

### üîç **Secret Scanning & Encryption Checks**
- **TruffleHog OSS**: Detects secrets in git history and current codebase
- **GitLeaks**: Advanced secret detection with custom rules
- **Detect-secrets**: Baseline secret scanning with AI-enhanced detection

### üî¨ **Static Analysis**
- **CodeQL**: Multi-language static analysis (JavaScript, Python, Java, Go, C#, C++)
- **Semgrep**: Custom rule-based detection with OWASP, security-audit, and specialized rulesets
- **Bandit**: Python-specific security linter

### üõ°Ô∏è **Vulnerability Scanning**
- **Trivy**: Container, filesystem, and dependency vulnerability scanning
- **NPM Audit**: Node.js dependency vulnerability detection
- **Safety**: Python package vulnerability scanning

### ü§ñ **AI-Based & Heuristic Analysis**
- Advanced pattern detection for suspicious code patterns
- Behavioral analysis simulation
- Custom heuristic rules for threat detection
- Anomaly detection in file permissions and sizes

### üìä **Reporting & Artifacts**
- Comprehensive security report generation
- SARIF format uploads to GitHub Security tab
- Artifact preservation for 30-90 days
- Critical vulnerability build failures

## Triggers

The workflow runs on:
- **Push events** to `main` and `develop` branches
- **Pull requests** to `main` branch
- **Weekly schedule** (Sundays at 2 AM UTC)
- **Manual dispatch** via GitHub Actions UI

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
- `FAIL_ON_CRITICAL`: Set to `true` to fail builds on critical vulnerabilities

### Repository Secrets (Optional)
- `GITLEAKS_LICENSE`: GitLeaks commercial license key

### Required Permissions
- `security-events: write` - For uploading SARIF results
- `contents: read` - For code checkout and analysis

## Modular Design

The workflow is designed for easy adaptation to other repositories:

1. **Language Matrix**: Easily modify the CodeQL language matrix
2. **Dependency Tools**: Conditional execution based on file presence
3. **Custom Rules**: Configurable Semgrep rulesets
4. **Scalable Architecture**: Independent jobs for parallel execution

## Usage in Other Repositories

To implement this security workflow in another repository:

1. Copy `.github/workflows/security-scan.yml` to your repository
2. Adjust the CodeQL language matrix for your tech stack
3. Modify dependency audit steps based on your dependencies
4. Configure any required repository secrets
5. Enable GitHub Advanced Security features

## Job Breakdown

### 1. Secret Scanning (`secret-scanning`)
- TruffleHog OSS secret detection
- GitLeaks comprehensive scanning
- Artifact upload for traceability

### 2. CodeQL Analysis (`codeql-analysis`)
- Multi-language static analysis
- Security-extended query suite
- Matrix strategy for parallel language scanning

### 3. Trivy Scanning (`trivy-scan`)
- Filesystem vulnerability scanning
- SARIF upload to Security tab
- Critical vulnerability detection

### 4. Semgrep Analysis (`semgrep-scan`)
- Custom rule-based detection
- OWASP Top 10 security checks
- Infrastructure security scanning

### 5. Dependency Audit (`dependency-audit`)
- NPM audit for Node.js projects
- Python Safety and Bandit checks
- Conditional execution based on project type

### 6. Advanced Scanning (`advanced-scanning`)
- AI-based pattern detection
- Behavioral analysis
- Heuristic threat detection

### 7. Report Aggregation (`security-report`)
- Comprehensive report generation
- Critical vulnerability assessment
- Build failure on critical issues

## Benefits

- **Real Security**: Replaces simulated scans with actual threat detection
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Multiple scanning techniques and tools
- **Early Detection**: Catches vulnerabilities before deployment
- **Automated Response**: Fails builds on critical vulnerabilities
- **Audit Trail**: Preserves scan results for compliance
- **Scalable**: Easy to adapt for organization-wide rollout

## Maintenance

- Workflow runs automatically on schedule and code changes
- Artifacts are retained for compliance and auditing
- Critical vulnerabilities will fail the build by default
- Regular updates to scanning tools via GitHub Actions marketplace

This implementation provides enterprise-grade security scanning suitable for mission-critical applications like the Sentinel Dashboard's cross-chain threat detection system.
